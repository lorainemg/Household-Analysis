# Household Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the "Individual Household Electric Power Consumption" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The analysis involves statistical methods, hypothesis testing, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction techniques to gain insights into household electricity consumption patterns.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption)
- **Timeframe**: 4 years of electric power consumption data
- **Attributes**: Various electrical parameters such as active power, reactive power, voltage, and current

## Analysis Phases

### Phase 1: Statistical Analysis

- **Population Sampling & Hypothesis Testing**:
  - Creating a normal population from the dataset
  - Extracting samples and comparing variances between attributes
- **Regression Analysis**:
  - Identifying linear relationships between variables

### Phase 2: Machine Learning Techniques

- **Dimensionality Reduction & Clustering**:
  - Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Implementing clustering techniques for better data interpretation
- **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)**:
  - Comparing means of specific characteristics across different groups

## Technologies Used

- **R Programming Language**
- **Statistical Libraries**
- **Machine Learning Techniques**
